# 📁 Linux Folder Structure

The Linux filesystem follows a **tree-like hierarchy**, starting from the root directory `/`.

Here’s a quick overview of important directories:

| Directory | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/` | 🔝 Root directory (top of the hierarchy) |
| `/bin` | 🧰 Essential command binaries (like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`) |
| `/boot` | 🥾 Boot files (includes the Linux kernel and bootloader files) |
| `/dev` | 📦 Device files (e.g., `/dev/sda` for hard drives) |
| `/etc` | ⚙️ System-wide configuration files |
| `/home` | 🏠 User home directories (`/home/harsh`, `/home/alex`, etc.) |
| `/lib` | 📚 Shared libraries used by system programs |
| `/media` | 💽 Mounted external devices (USB, CD/DVD) |
| `/mnt` | 📦 Temporary mount point for manually mounting filesystems |
| `/opt` | ➕ Optional software packages |
| `/proc` | 📄 Virtual files for system and process info (like memory, CPU) |
| `/root` | 👑 Home directory for the root user |
| `/sbin` | 🔧 System binaries (only for root/admin tasks) |
| `/tmp` | 🧹 Temporary files (cleared on reboot) |
| `/usr` | 🌍 User-installed software and libraries |
| `/var` | 📈 Variable data (logs, mail, spool files) |

🧠 **Tip:** Run `ls /` on your Linux system to explore these folders.
